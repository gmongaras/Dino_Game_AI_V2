# Dino_Game_AI_V2
AI that learns to play the Google dino game using an improved version of NEAT


The AI is using the genetic algorithm. So, each dino initially makes random moves depending on its inputs into the neural network. Once all dinos die, a new population is created from a weighted selection. The algorithm used in the original repo wasn't really using based on NEAT. The algorithm used for this new repo is based on the original NEAT paper.
